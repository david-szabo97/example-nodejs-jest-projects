# Jest projects example

An example project that uses Jest projects to run unit, integration, and E2E tests separately.

This project from one of my [blog article](https://daveiscoding.com//separate-nodejs-unit-integration-and-e2e-tests-using-jest-projects)s.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Run it

- `npm test`- Runs all tests (unit, integration and E2E)
- `npm run test:unit` - Runs unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Runs integration tests only
- `npm run test:e2e` - Runs E2E tests only
